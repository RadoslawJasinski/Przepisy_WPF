## General info
This is a continuation of my first application that was made in Windows Forms. I used WPF in this project.
The application was created to solve the problem with monotonous dinners :) 
The search engine by ingredients can search for dishes that we can prepare from what we have in the fridge.

Additionally, I wanted learn how to use WPF, XAML, MySQL, and NuGets better.

## Functions
Done:
+ Search recipes by ingredients selected by the user, 
+ Search recipes by keyword,
+ Categories 
+ Print the recipe
+ News

In the future:
- User login,
- Add recipes to favorites,
- Dark theme
